# Fuzzy-Genetic Control System for Semi-Submersible Platform Dynamic Positioning

This project focuses on the control of a semi-submersible drilling platform using a hybrid approach that combines Genetic Algorithms with Fuzzy Logic. The primary objective is to develop and validate adaptive control strategies for the semi-submersible platform under both simulation conditions and physical experimental implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Platform Modeling

The platform model is developed based on the real-world **Stena Don semi-submersible rig**, with the following key components:

- Analysis of the motion structure and dynamic behavior of the semi-submersible system.  
- Definition of different operational modes, including station-keeping and trajectory-following.  
- Identification of key environmental and mechanical factors affecting system performance.  
- Full system simulation in the **MATLAB/Simulink** environment to evaluate control effectiveness and dynamic stability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Control Methods

### 1. Adaptive Fuzzy Controller (AFC)
- Uses position error and its derivative as inputs.
- Applies fuzzy inference rules to determine control action.
- Enables real-time adaptation to system changes.

### 2. Constrained Fuzzy Genetic Optimized Controller (CFGOC)
- Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to tune fuzzy membership functions.
- Considers physical limitations of thrusters (force and azimuth angle).
- Provides constrained yet optimized control performance.
